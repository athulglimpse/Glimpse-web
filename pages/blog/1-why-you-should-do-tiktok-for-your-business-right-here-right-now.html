        If up until now your business doesn’t fully realise the true power of
        TikTok marketing, then you’re deliberately let- ting the big fish get
        away.
      </p>
      <p>
        The popularity of TikTok spread like wildfire with 1 billion monthly
        active users to date. The amount of unique, creative, and engaging
        content shared daily snowballs like crazy reaching a nice mix of
        audiences within and beyond the platform itself. Many brands
        especially small, local ones find it almost impossible to achieve
        virality on other social media spheres despite exerting a great deal
        of effort... but on TikTok it’s just a stone’s throw away.
      </p>
      <p>
        All you need is a little dose of spontaneous creativity, a handful of
        pixie dust, and magic ensues. Here are THE reasons why your business
        should leverage TikTok and turn it into a marketing machine if you are
        to grow your business on all fronts:
      </p>
      <div class="list_block">
        <strong>1. Discoverability is phenomenal</strong>
        <p>
          TikTok was built where its algorithm centres aro und users’
          interests, unlike on other social sites where content will only be
          served by the people you follow or those within your social circle.
          Brands are reaping the benefits of an interest-based algorithm
          because they would be able to reach a vast demographic without the
          common pre-requisite of having a large following.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="list_block">
        <strong>2. It generates astronomical organic engagement</strong>
        <p>
          Because the social platform heavily focuses on what we like rather
          than who we like, it provides us with a nev- er-ending stream of
          relevant content. As a result, users are more likely to celebrate
          what’s hot through the spirit of co-creation and sharing. If a brand
          launches a campaign that ends up to be highly engaging, the TikTok
          community would be recreating the same post, producing a ripple
          effect where everyone rides the wave.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="list_block">
        <strong>3. Brand lift takes off</strong>
        <p>
          What happens when you combine sky-high discoverability and
          engagement together? Your brand is ready for take-off! Consider
          TikTok as a golden goose and your business would just lie in the
          corner getting fat on gains.
        </p>
        <p>
          Figuratively speaking, TikTok walks through people at every stage of
          the customer journey making it a crucial part of your marketing and
          advertising strategies. If you’re planning to improve brand
          awareness and develop affinity with your customers, then you already
          know by now where to go.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="list_block">
        <strong>4. Diversified and unique audiences</strong>
        <p>
          As opposed to other social media websites, TikTok’s offer of
          unduplicated users is what makes it rise above the rest. People are
          consuming videos right on the platform giving brands the vantage
          point to connect with their target market.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is very important especially for advertisers because they were
          afforded the opportunity to laser-target interested people who put
          value on the products and services that they promote. Your total
          spend is maximised, you cater to your best customers, and you get
          rid of the bottom-feeders. It’s a win-win situation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, TikTok is the ground zero for creative, trendsetting
          posts which also means that it is the best place for crossing
          content over multiple channels like on Facebook and Instagram.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vertical videos, on TikTok in particular, have the power to
          transform your brands in ways that you can’t imagine. You just have
          to carefully plan and strategise to get the most of it — or you can
          hire a digital agency like Glimpse to do all the hard work for you.
