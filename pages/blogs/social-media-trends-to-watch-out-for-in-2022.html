      <p>
        Social media is constantly evolving and producing new opportunities to build a deeper connection with the
        audience. As of 2022, we say goodbye to the simple updates and hello to growing digital communities. Moreover,
        we predict further improvements on the previously introduced trends and greater established ideas making a mere
        concept into a reality.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of the trends that we have seen take off so far this year are:
      </p>
      <div class="list_block">
        <strong>1. Creators</strong>
        <p>
          With the popularity of short vertical videos on TikTok, Reels on Instagram, and Short on Youtube we’ve noticed
          that people not only interact more with this bite-sized form of content but also turn into creators
          themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          There has been a massive growth in the creator economy due to the prevalent tools allowing them to
          communicate with the audience and collaborate with brands.
        </p>
        <p>
          With respect to B2B strategies, marketers have begun to invest in this social media strategy. They can
          effectively interact with their users through creators as they generate engagement and have a well-established
          presence on social media.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="list_block">
        <strong>2. Personalisation</strong>
        <p>
          Over the years, a touch of personality is still king as compared to automated messaging. Marketers must aim to
          interact with their users on a personal level and channel their human side. Create more relatable content, use
          storytelling to your advantage, show the audience that you are listening to their needs and are here to
          deliver.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another way to approach this strategy is by putting the people before the profit and the latter will follow.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="list_block">
        <strong>3. Brand lift takes off</strong>
        <p>
          What happens when you combine sky-high discoverability and
          engagement together? Your brand is ready for take-off! Consider
          TikTok as a golden goose and your business would just lie in the
          corner getting fat on gains.
        </p>
        <p>
          Figuratively speaking, TikTok walks through people at every stage of
          the customer journey making it a crucial part of your marketing and
          advertising strategies. If you’re planning to improve brand
          awareness and develop affinity with your customers, then you already
          know by now where to go.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="list_block">
        <strong>4. Diversified and unique audiences</strong>
        <p>
          As opposed to other social media websites, TikTok’s offer of
          unduplicated users is what makes it rise above the rest. People are
          consuming videos right on the platform giving brands the vantage
          point to connect with their target market.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is very important especially for advertisers because they were
          afforded the opportunity to laser-target interested people who put
          value on the products and services that they promote. Your total
          spend is maximised, you cater to your best customers, and you get
          rid of the bottom-feeders. It’s a win-win situation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, TikTok is the ground zero for creative, trendsetting
          posts which also means that it is the best place for crossing
          content over multiple channels like on Facebook and Instagram.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vertical videos, on TikTok in particular, have the power to
          transform your brands in ways that you can’t imagine. You just have
          to carefully plan and strategise to get the most of it — or you can
          hire a digital agency like Glimpse to do all the hard work for you.
