        <p>
          If up until now your business doesn’t fully realise the true power of
          TikTok marketing, then you’re deliberately let- ting the big fish get
          away.
        </p>
        <p>
          The popularity of TikTok spread like wildfire with 1 billion monthly
          active users to date. The amount of unique, creative, and engaging
          content shared daily snowballs like crazy reaching a nice mix of
          audiences within and beyond the platform itself. Many brands
          especially small, local ones find it almost impossible to achieve
          virality on other social media spheres despite exerting a great deal
          of effort... but on TikTok it’s just a stone’s throw away.
        </p>
        <p>
          All you need is a little dose of spontaneous creativity, a handful of
          pixie dust, and magic ensues. Here are THE reasons why your business
          should leverage TikTok and turn it into a marketing machine if you are
          to grow your business on all fronts:
        </p>
        <div class="list_block">
          <strong>1. Discoverability is phenomenal</strong>
          <p>
            TikTok was built where its algorithm centres aro und users’
            interests, unlike on other social sites where content will only be
            served by the people you follow or those within your social circle.
            Brands are reaping the benefits of an interest-based algorithm
            because they would be able to reach a vast demographic without the
            common pre-requisite of having a large following.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="list_block">
          <strong>2. It generates astronomical organic engagement</strong>
          <p>
            Because the social platform heavily focuses on what we like rather
            than who we like, it provides us with a nev- er-ending stream of
            relevant content. As a result, users are more likely to celebrate
            what’s hot through the spirit of co-creation and sharing. If a brand
            launches a campaign that ends up to be highly engaging, the TikTok
            community would be recreating the same post, producing a ripple
            effect where everyone rides the wave.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="list_block">
          <strong>3. Brand lift takes off</strong>
          <p>
            What happens when you combine sky-high discoverability and
            engagement together? Your brand is ready for take-off! Consider
            TikTok as a golden goose and your business would just lie in the
            corner getting fat on gains.
          </p>
          <p>
            Figuratively speaking, TikTok walks through people at every stage of
            the customer journey making it a crucial part of your marketing and
            advertising strategies. If you’re planning to improve brand
            awareness and develop affinity with your customers, then you already
            know by now where to go.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="list_block">
          <strong>4. Diversified and unique audiences</strong>
          <p>
            As opposed to other social media websites, TikTok’s offer of
            unduplicated users is what makes it rise above the rest. People are
            consuming videos right on the platform giving brands the vantage
            point to connect with their target market.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is very important especially for advertisers because they were
            afforded the opportunity to laser-target interested people who put
            value on the products and services that they promote. Your total
            spend is maximised, you cater to your best customers, and you get
            rid of the bottom-feeders. It’s a win-win situation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, TikTok is the ground zero for creative, trendsetting
            posts which also means that it is the best place for crossing
            content over multiple channels like on Facebook and Instagram.
          </p>
          <p>
            Vertical videos, on TikTok in particular, have the power to
            transform your brands in ways that you can’t imagine. You just have
            to carefully plan and strategise to get the most of it — or you can
            hire a digital agency like Glimpse to do all the hard work for you.
